# Welcome-to-West-World

A Click Game with a West World theme and constructed using React.

## Overview

The application was designed to provide a West World themed click-game. In this game a user will click on a series of "Host Cards" that feature a character from the hit HBO show. The goal is to click on all twelve characters only once within a round. The host cards are shuffled after each click to add difficulty to the game. To provide more of a narrative to the game. A message about the character is also presented to the user upon clicking a card.

The program was written as an introduction to REACT assignment for a coding class.
